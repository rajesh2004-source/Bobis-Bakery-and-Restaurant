## Configure Environment Variables

Create a file named **`.env`** in the **root directory** (for the server) and a separate **`.env`** file inside the **`client`** directory (for the frontend). **You must provide your own MongoDB connection string and API keys.**

**Server (`.env`) Example:**

```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=[YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING_HERE]
JWT_SECRET=[A_RANDOM_SECRET_STRING_FOR_JWT]
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=[YOUR_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID]
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=[YOUR_RAZORPAY_SECRET]
```

**Client (`client/.env`) Example:**

```
REACT_APP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

## Install Dependencies & Run

#### **A. Install Dependencies**

Navigate to both the root and `client` directories to install dependencies:

```bash
# In the root directory:
npm install 

# Then, in the client directory:
cd client
npm install
cd ..
```

#### **B. Start the Application**

Start the server and client in separate terminals (or use your custom run command):

```bash
# To start the server (in the root directory):
npm start  
# OR: node server.js

# To start the client (in the client directory):
cd client
npm start
```

The application will typically be accessible at `http://localhost:[Your Client Port, e.g., 3000]`.
